# Overview

## What is djinni?

Djinni is a tool for generating cross-language type declarations and interface bindings to connect C++ with either Java, Objective-C, Python or C#.

Djinni can be used to interface cross-platform C++ library code with platform-specific code on any popular operating system. Djinni was announced by Dropbox at CppCon 2014:

!!! tip "Djinni ❤️ Community!"

    Dropbox ended maintenance of Djinni in March 2020. Since June 2020 this fork gives Djinni a second life by maintaining it as a community-driven project in the [cross-language-cpp](https://github.com/cross-language-cpp) organization!

## How the magic works

To call from one programming language to another, usually a lot of gluecode is required.
Djinni automatically generates this gluecode from an [interface definition language (IDL)](djinni-generator/idl.md).

All you need to do is implement the interfaces generated by djinni in one language and use it from the other language. Djinni takes care of the heavy lifting: Converting data-types, managing pointers and managing memory.


??? example "Example: Call C++ Code from Java or Objective-C"

    This Djinni Interface defines a class that is implemented in C++ and can be called from Java or Objective-C:
    ```
    HelloWorld = interface +c {
        static create(): HelloWorld;
        fromCpp(): string
    }
    ```



    === "Implemented in C++"

        ``` cpp
        #include "djinni/generated/HelloWorld.hpp"

        class HelloWorldImpl : public HelloWorld {
        public:
            static std::shared_ptr<HelloWorld> create() {
                return std::make_shared<HelloWorldImpl>();
            }
            std::string fromCpp() {
                return "Hello From C++!";
            }
        }
        ```

    === "Called from Java"

        ``` java
        HelloWorld helloWorld = HelloWorld.create();
        System.out.println(helloWorld.fromCpp());
        // Hello from C++!
        ```

    === "or Objective-C"

        ``` objc
        HelloWorld *helloWorld = [HelloWorld create];
        NSLog([helloWorld fromCpp]);
        // Hello from C++!
        ```

??? example "Example: Call Java/Objective-C Code from C++"

    This Djinni interface can be implemented in either Java or Objective-C, and can be called from C++:

    ```
    HelloWorld = interface +j +o {
        fromLanguage(): string;
    }
    ```


    === "Implemented in Java"

        ``` java
        public class HelloWorldJava extends HelloWorld {
            @Override
            String fromLanguage() {
                return "from Java";
            }
        } 
        ```

    === "or Objective-C"

        ``` objc
        @interface HelloWorldObjC : NSObject <HelloWorld>
        - (NSString)fromLanguage; 
        @end

        @implementation HelloWorldObjC
        - (NSString)fromLanguage {
            return "from Objective-C";
        }
        @end
        ```

    === "Called from C++"

        ``` cpp
        std::cout << helloWorldInstance->fromLanguage() << std::endl;
        ```




## Main Features

- Generates parallel C++, Java, Objective-C, Python and C++/CLI type definitions from a single interface description file.
- Supports the intersection of the languages' primitive types, and user-defined enums, flags, records, and interfaces.
- Generates interface code allowing bidirectional calls between C++ and ...
    * ... Java (with JNI) 
    * ... Objective-C (with Objective-C++)
    * ... Python (with CFFI)
    * ... C# (with C++/CLI)
- Can autogenerate comparator functions (equality, ordering) on data types.

## Components of Djinni

Djinni consists of two core components:

1. **[Generator](djinni-generator/setup.md)**: Command-line tool that takes an IDL file as input and generates the gluecode.
2. **[Support lib](djinni-support-lib/install.md)**: Library that is required for the gluecode to work.
